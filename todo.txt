move lib into chess4j-java and remove parent

clean up initialization process.

return full stats and compare for equality

clean up "print search stats"

re-enable draw-by-rep.  find a positions where it matters!  then replay moves to fix.

hash age - look for "less brittle" way to hash values from chess4j

timed searches

verify pondering

remove any unneeded handlers (probably the getters for hashing.  also don't need mvvlva.  keep SEE.)

clean up public headers

retest positions

consider calling native code to convert to/from native moves

look for any remaining TODO or FIXME statements

---

doxygen cleanup.  leave on headers only.
