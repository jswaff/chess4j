log4j issue

extend "always5" test to invoke something from prophet4lib.  perhaps create a simple function for
knight pst value

create JNI function that requires a position structure

conditionally load: see https://gist.github.com/amcclosky/2997867

cannot execute Eval tests within IDE in Windows - would require running IntelliJ using X-server
(or just do mvn -Dtest=EvalTest#testAlways5 test)
