return node counts and verify equality in handler

should not need to clear hash on every search

return full stats and compare for equality

remove JNI code

make from/to native move functions private

remove chess4j-native module!

remove any unneeded handlers (probably the getters for hashing.  also don't need mvvlva.  keep SEE.)

clean up public headers

re-enable draw-by-rep.  find a positions where it matters!  then replay moves to fix.

timed searches

verify pondering

retest positions

consider calling native code to convert to/from native moves

doxygen cleanup.  leave on headers only.
